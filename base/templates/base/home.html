                    <hr>
                    <p>I am a Junior at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. From high school, I've
                        been really interested in business and computer science, so the best way to mix 
                        these was to major in Information Systems. I'm always eager to work on new projects
                        in Python or any other programming languages that interest me.</p>
                    <p>Recently, I'm learning how to cook and bake, which I've never done before, and it
                        turned out to be very fun. It's also the best way to spend time with family.</p>

                    <h5>My Skills</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Python, Django, C++, Flask, Analytical skills, time management, and organization</p>
                    <p>I also like to learn new programming languages. I recently
                        developed an interest for the Go programming language because
                        it has the aspects of c++, Java, and Python combined.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I like to work on new projects to enhance my skills, and it's also the 
                        best way for me to learn new concepts. I worked on a Django website, which was
                        a customer management platform, where customers have the ability to add, remove,
                        edit items in their view. I also worked on a To-Do app in Django, which is fun
                        to interact with.

                    <hr>
                    <p>The best way for me to learn is when I physically code on my own.
                        I watch several YouTube videos of tutorials, and then I add my own
                        ideas to the projects. I also like to read interesting books on 
                        things that interest me.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>After learning a little bit about Python and working on some projects, 
                        I'm seeking an internship to enhance my skills even more. I would love 
                        to learn from a great mentor that's experienced and ethnusiastic.</p>
